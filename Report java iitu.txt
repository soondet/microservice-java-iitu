Report:
We create driver and then bus.
And assign this drivers to buses.
So every bus has its own trip and many buses can ride by one trip.
Every trip has its own locations.Example can be start:Atirau and end:Almaty.
So for one trip there can be many tickets and this tickets can be sold to passengers by their IIN.
Tickets are limitied and it has own price.
